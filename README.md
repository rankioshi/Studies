# Algorithms and Interview Preparation

This repository contains my personal studies and implementations of classic algorithms and data structures, designed to help me (and others) prepare for technical interviews and deepen understanding of computer science fundamentals.

## Contents

- **AVL Tree (Python):**  
  An advanced implementation of AVL trees, a self-balancing binary search tree, written in Python. This code demonstrates insertion, deletion, and balancing operations, with comments and examples for learning purposes.

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm (C):**  
  An efficient implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm in C. The code is structured for clarity and performance, suitable for understanding graph algorithms and their applications.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to serve as a study resource for algorithms and data structures, with a focus on problems and solutions commonly encountered in technical interviews. More algorithms, data structures, and problem solutions will be added over time.

## How to Use

- Browse the folders and files for code examples and explanations.
- Each implementation includes comments and, where applicable, example usage.
- Feel free to use, modify, or contribute to the code for your own learning or interview preparation.

## Future Plans

- Add more algorithms in different languages (e.g., Java, C++).
- Include problem-solving strategies and coding challenges.
- Expand documentation and add more detailed explanations.
